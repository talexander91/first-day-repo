# Module 06 Mini-Project: Search Engine Extravaganza!
​
In this activity, you will build a search engine that lets users find information about movies, pokemon, or Star Wars characters. (Only choose *One* API)
​
---
​
## Instructions
​
The completed application should meet the following criteria:
​
* As a user, I can submit a search query to one of the 3 available API's.
​
* As a user, I then see 5 pieces of the matching criteria rendered below the search (ex: 5 facts about the movie, 5 details of the pokemon, or 5 properties of the Star Wars character).
​
* The application must use Bootstrap and its grid system for layout/styling.
​
* The application must be deployed to Github Pages when complete.
​
To learn about how to use these APIs, check out the documentation of the following:

## �� Hints
​
Will every search return data? If I search for a pokemon that doesn't exist, what will happen? What about a movie? What about a Star Wars Character?
​
## �� Bonus
​
* How can I save a list of favorites in local storage and render it to the page for the user to view at a later date?
